I am a Ph.D. candidate, supervised by <a href="https://innovate.ee.ucla.edu/prof-ozcan-brief-biosketch.html" target="_blank">Prof. Aydogan Ozcan</a> in <a href="https://www.ee.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">UCLA</a>.

<br />
My research interests are in the areas of computational imaging, machine learning, and image processing.

<br />
I received my M.S. degree in <a href="https://eee.metu.edu.tr/" target="_blank">Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EE)</a> from <a href="http://www.metu.edu.tr/" target="_blank">Middle East Technical University (METU)</a>, where I have also completed my B.S. in both EE and Physics.

<br />
During my undergraduate research and M.S. studies with <a href="https://blog.metu.edu.tr/figeno/" target="_blank">Assoc. Prof. Figen S. Oktem</a>, I have particularly focused on the classical phase retrieval problem and phase-space optics. I have also worked on the resolution enhancement of microscopy images by exploiting deep learning algorithms and representation learning under the supervision of <a href="http://aykut.koc.bilkent.edu.tr/" target="_blank">Asst. Prof. Aykut Koc</a>.
